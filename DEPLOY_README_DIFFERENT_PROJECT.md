# Hebrew Voice Bot — Telegram + ElevenLabs

A Telegram bot that converts text to speech (Hebrew female voice) and converts voice messages to a female voice using ElevenLabs.

- **Send text** -> bot replies with a spoken voice message
- **Send a voice recording** -> bot converts it to a female voice and sends it back

## Modes

`/settings` lets each user pick between two modes:

- **Casual** — Default. Uses ElevenLabs _Instant Voice Clone_ (IVC). Fast, only needs a few seconds of audio, voice is ready immediately.
- **Premium** — Uses ElevenLabs _Professional Voice Clone_ (PVC). Requires at least 30 minutes of clean audio per voice, an in-Telegram captcha verification step, and waiting hours for fine-tuning to complete. The result is the highest-fidelity clone ElevenLabs offers.

PVC requires the ElevenLabs Creator tier or higher (each PVC slot eats into the account's professional-voice quota). The bot polls training status every 5 minutes via a JobQueue and DMs the owner when each Premium voice is ready.
